WebGL Experiments
==================
This repository contains my experiments learning 3D graphics and WebGL.

Many thanks to the following resources:

LaTeX
-----
There are a lot of new concepts and WebGL process specifics that I've found hard
to absorb quickly. To help myself learn faster and retain what I learn longer
I created a LaTeX note sheet. Hopefully I can synthesize what's important and 
improve my notes iteratively as my understanding grows.
